## 🔍 Key Features Explained

### Leave Tracker Formula

The application uses a mathematical approach to calculate attendance requirements:

#### For Students Below 75%

**Formula:**
```
(attended + x) / (total + x) ≥ 0.75
```

Solving for x (classes needed):
```
x ≥ (0.75 × total - attended) / 0.25
```

**Example:**
- Current: 18 attended / 30 total = 60%
- Calculation: `(0.75 × 30 - 18) / 0.25 = 12`
- Result: **Attend 12 consecutive classes to reach 75%**

#### For Students Above 75%

**Formula:**
```
(attended - y) / (total + y) ≥ 0.75
```

Solving for y (classes can miss):
```
y ≤ (attended - 0.75 × total) / 1.75
```

**Example:**
- Current: 45 attended / 50 total = 90%
- Calculation: `(45 - 0.75 × 50) / 1.75 ≈ 4`
- Result: **Can miss up to 4 classes and stay above 75%**

### Data Storage

All data is stored locally in the browser's LocalStorage:

```javascript
// Student credentials
localStorage.setItem('currentUser', JSON.stringify(userObject));

// Attendance records
localStorage.setItem('attendance_' + userId, JSON.stringify(attendanceData));

// Session information
localStorage.setItem('sessionActive', 'true');
```

### Color Coding System

Visual indicators help students quickly assess their status:

| Color | Range | Status | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 🟢 Green | ≥75% | Safe | Maintain attendance |
| 🟡 Yellow | 60-74% | Warning | Improve attendance |
| 🔴 Red | <60% | Critical | Urgent attention needed |
